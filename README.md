# Food-Inflation-Tracker-Project

The purpose of this project is to inspect prices for "select" food items over in Canada over the past 5 years and answer some of the most burning questions including:

1. What is the most expensive grocery item in Canada?
2. What state has the lowest standard of living? 
3. What grocery item is expected to skyrocket within the next few years?
4. How will the increase in the grocery item prices affect people?
5. Are the prices expected to continue increasing?
6. What food item's price has increased the slowest and in what state?

Original Data to do this project was pulled from Statistics Canada Website: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810024501&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=02&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2018&cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=02&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2023&referencePeriods=20180201%2C20230201
